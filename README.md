## Data

Running this code requires a copy of the GROUNDED dataset (Ort T, Gilitschenski I, Rus D. GROUNDED: A localizing ground penetrating radar evaluation dataset for learning to localize in inclement weather[J]. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2023, 42(10): 901-916.)


# Usage

`demo.py` contains the majority of the code and selectable parameters which we'll discuss in mode detail below.
